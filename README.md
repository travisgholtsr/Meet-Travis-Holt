- 👋 Hi, I’m @vulcanadagency
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and helping people achieve their dreams.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything all over again after a severe head injury, but things are progressing well. Learning things for the second time means I am getting to be better than ever before despite having amnesia.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects I have in my repository que or open to new ideas and ventures upon request.
- 📫 How to reach me is best by email travisgholt@outlook.com.
